How to store whole numbers:
- For these numbers we use integers.
- We can use really big numbers on swift.
- We use _ to make numbers easier to read: 100_000_000, swift just ignores the underscores
- The shorthand operators are like the c++ ones: +=, -=, etc.
- .isMultipleOf(number) returns a bool that indicates if the number is divisible by the parameter
