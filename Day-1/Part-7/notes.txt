How to store decimal numbers:
- Floating point numbers are double precision on Swift
- Doubles are a total diferent type of data on swift, doubles have a little inacuraccy on them.
- We cant do operations with integers and flat numbers directly, even if its 2.0, for example.
- We can do operations between integers and floating numbers when we convert one of them to the other number's type, example:
If a is an integer and b is a double:
let c = Double(a) + b

- As a type safe language, swift doesn't allow us to change variable types.
- Floating numbers have the same operators as integers, for example, *= 2 works for an floating point number even if 2 appears to be an integer
- Swift allows us to use the legacy type CGFloat and Doubles without caring about replacing a CGFloat with a Double.
- The float values inacuraccy is due the computer nature to store numbers on binaries.
