How to create Strings:
- We can use " on strings as long they are with a \.

Multi-line strings:
- we need to use """ arround the string in order to make a multiline 
string.
- .count return us the string size.
- swift handles and count emoji very well.
- .uppercased() returns the string uppercased.B
- whe dont need the () on method calls if swift just will read data
- .hasPrefix("...") returns a boolean that indicates if the string starts 
with the described words.
- .hasSufix("...") does the same, but with the end of the string.
- strings are case sensitive!
